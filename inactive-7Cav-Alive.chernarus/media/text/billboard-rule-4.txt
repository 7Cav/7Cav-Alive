4. Combat Air Patrol and Combat Support must abide by specific rules of engagement<br/>
Server rules of engagement for these units restrict combat air patrol to enemy jets and airborne combat support to Gorgons, Kamyshes, Tanks and Tigrises.  All other targets may be engaged only if infantry on the ground that can see the target request you to make an attack.  In general, infantry and armor direct the progression of an operation, with other assets in support.
